Installation instructions for the GG Webservices extension for eZ Publish
=========================================================================

1. activate the extension following the standard eZ Publish procedures
  (remember to regenerate the ezp_extension.php autoload file)

2. clear the template cache

3. there is no fight club!

4. If you will be using the webservices client part of the extension, to avoid
   the webservice logs to grow indefinitely and potentially fill up your
   hard disk, add the rotatewslogs.php cronjob script to a cronjob part
   you run periodically, such as 'infrequent', or schedule execution of the
   ``rotatewslogs`` part (see the documentation aboyt cronjobs for more details
   on how to set it up)

5. If you want to expose webservice functionality to logged-in users (such as for
   ajax call using jronrpc), you should disable the ezformtoken extension
