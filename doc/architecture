Two layers of code can be found

1) Base Layer

   This code has to
   . remain independent of eZP (ie. no right to use any eZP code)
   . keep the same API (as much as possible) as the eZP soap library

2) eZ Layer

   The glue code that allows the base code to be invoked via templates, ini files
   to be used for storing configuration and the debugger to work
