Roughly sorted by priority:

- allow users to specify more options for $.jsonrpc (same as Y.io.jsonrpc does)

- add a fetch function for templates which allows to get the full response wrapped in a tpl object

- add a better version of ezwsclient::send() that does not wrap response in an array

- make sure we convert charsets where possible / do not break json/xml decoding in responses because of it

- add support for http redirects when using the http1.0 client

- add url parsing (both in/out) for rest where parameters are in path instead of query string

- doc comparing ez soap support to ggphpsoap support

- doc w. feature list

- add to ggeZWebservices some methods to derive class names from protocol and viceversa (esp. for phpsoap)

- look into using guzzle for http layer (reimplement ggWebservicesClient::send and company)

- soap calls: implement returning something where end user can distinguish between an array and an object, at least from tpl layer

- client: implement oauth 2 client capabilities

- client: test POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD methods for REST client:
  + when not to put any payload? currently get/head, but should eb true for delete too
  + if nameVar is given, when doing POST/PUT/DELETE calls, keep the method name in the url or put it in the payload?

- test proper support for cdata section, entities, in ggSimpleTemplateXML

- replace method(), setmethod(), setOptions('method') with corresponding 'verb' ? clarify / unify this naming conundrum

- client: implement per-server fixed parameters, useful for eg. rest client where the type=json is more or less fixed
  + test if it works already by simply putting query string in server url in ini file

- support for wssecurity

- implement ...?wsdl url pattern as alternative to ..../wsdl

- server: improve soap server w. wsdl support
  + proper parsing of called function name from xml (not from soapaction http header)
  + use reflection for generating wsdl if user did not provide any type info
  + finish use of reflection for generating wsdl for plain  (non-ezpo) classes: derive property type from phpdoc
  + test: will ezpo subclasses actually serialize properly when using ggphpsoapserver or do we need to define type maps?
  + build proper xsd for methods that are registered with many signatures (as it is done eg. in xmlrpc to have optional params)
  + allow method signatures that contain choices between non-simple types (eg: eZDB | eZDBInterface )
  + test recursive type defs (array of array of int)
  + verify support for 'null' php type
  + allow de-inlining of included xsd via view parameter
    + try to mitigate "dos attack" when user goes to .../webservices/wsdl/(view)/html and there is some ezpo class in the wsdl (xslt goes in a loop or close to it)
  + verify proper namespace usage in out-of-line-xsd
  + soap 1.2 support (needs php resp class to have 1.2 serialization first)
  + wsdl 2.0 support
  + in wsdl 2.0, add more binding descriptions (rest, xmlrpc, ...)

- soap server: usage of proper soap error codes: VersionMismatch, MustUnderstand, Client, Server (see http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/#_Toc478383510)s

- server: add a soap controller based on ggphpsoap + webservicescontroller.php (instead of ezsoap)

- client: test: using CURL and proxy / complex auths works?
  + prevent curl from adding useless "accept: */*" header
  + test: bug using curl+compress request+soap call to ms servers

- client: test https support with and without curl, with and without proxy too

- add to the base client:
  + automatic cookie support
  + send($array) with keepalive (both curl & by hand)
  + rebuilding of $_POST for compressed requests containing form data
  + more ssl options (and in debugger too)

- client: add to ezwsclient support for proxy auth type, proxy conf via options[] (and in debugger too)

- client: return more specific error codes than ERROR_BAD_RESPONSE when decoding response fails

- client: allow usage of different patterns for call();
  . throw exception on errors instead of returning response object
  . return response objects even on http errors (?)

- add even more client samples, eg. to call webservices on facebook, youtube, amazon, google

- in debugger:
  + use templates for output of action.php
  + add siteaccess choice for local server on the left-hand col (nb: looks like getting correct urls for other sa is quite hard... langswitcher does it for nodes only?)
  + allow to hide/show client's options
  + improve layout (eg. 1st line, visualeditor space on top, add admin2 tpl for left menu with resizing handle, etc...)
  + allow picking preferred content-type for responses when using ezjscore, same as done for rest
  + investigate fatal errors in soap client, wsdl mode, when parsing a non-wsdl page (they should be caught as exceptions except they're not)
  + allow to create sample ini block for current server; also sample tpl/php code for current call
  + ezjscore methods: improve parsing of phpdoc comments to get signature
  + test fix 4 bug: "url for local server in debugger is wrong when using forcevhost w.out rewriting rules (also without forcevhost?)"
  + parse all Options from wsproviders.ini for loading remote server config from left col (some are not yest supported)
  + fix: why using the same session cookie of admin session to send a ws call stalls the debugger?

- add jsonrpc 2.0 support (both client and server)

- add support for xmlrpc datatypes base64 and datetime (check if it works when using plain php classes)

- server: add a script that creates initialize.php from a wsdl file

- add some doc showing the client/request/response and server/request/response interaction to make it easier to remember that requests are also used server-side (and responses client-side)

- server: add 'plain' xml format to REST server output. see eg http://snipplr.com/view/3491/convert-php-array-to-xml-or-simple-xml-object-if-you-wish/
  or http://svn.php.net/viewvc/pear/packages/XML_Serializer/trunk/XML/Serializer.php?revision=294967&view=markup
  Also finish support for php/phps (parsing of Accept header)

- server: test support for calling ezjscore and plain-registered methods with index_ajax controller; test again custom controller too

- add siteaccess limitation to proxy view

- verify js changes in Y.io.ez from 1.0.0 to 1.5.0 and merge in Y.io.jsonrpc
  + test loading Y.io.ez from Yui in eZP 4.4 up to 4.7

- debugger: use ezjscore to load yui 3 in debugger <= upgrade debugger to yui2in3

- server: test module view that does ws execution (memory, time) vs. using jsonrpc.php vs. index_ajax.php

- add some friendly method as replacement for ggeZWebservicesClient::send

- finish proxy module
  => add soap support. Need to create a new soap server class, too?
  => add POST/PUT/DELETE (rest) support. Need to create a new server class, too? nb: could do with basically json/php serialized/ encoding of results (see solr-supported formats too)
  => add fine-grained policy control with per_server_per_method limitations (this one needs server to support listMethods() call), possibly per_siteaccess?
  => move it away from usage of ggeZWebservicesClient::send() method

- server: allow ws controllers to operate in no-session mode (useful? since 4.4 whole of eZ can be sessionless)

- server: add a new controller file capable to do multi-protocol requests
  + make it also compatible with ezsjcore

- server: add optional extended logging of received ws calls and outgoing responses (use ezdebugsettings or a custom log file?)

- lobby ezjscore to provide list of exposed methods, api docs

- server: improve input parameter type validation

- server: add a compatibility layer to import webservices designed for ezrest too

- debugger: add js-based debugger for calls to local server

- add a testsuite (eg. to test all the error codes after shuffling them around)

- allow extension ro run on phpxmlrpc/phpjsonrpc/nusoap if php extensions are missing

- client: add support for curl multi calls to execute multiple calls in parallel
