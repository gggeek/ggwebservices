Changes from 0.7 to 0.8 - released 2011/x/y

*General:

- Server: Add support for responding to SOAP calls

  the url to be used is: .../webservices/execute/phpsoap

  advantages compared to usage of the custom soap.php controller:
  . fine-grained access control (roles can be granted access to a specific set of webservices)
  . access control based on the IP address of the client
  . better (?) support for wsdl, as the php native soap server class is used

- Server: Add support for displaying wsdl

  the url to be used are:
  .../webservices/wsdl (for a complete wsdl, filtered by user permissions)
  .../webservices/wsdl/$method (for a wsdl describing a single method)

  also human readable information corresponding to the wsdl is available at:
  .../webservices/wsdl/(view)/html
  .../webservices/wsdl/$method/(view)/html

  For the moment, only wsdl 1.1 is supported

  More information about soap & wsdl usage in the doc/soap_readme file

*Bugfixes:

- Debugger: fix list of parameters shown when executing 'describe method'


*Incompatible changes
