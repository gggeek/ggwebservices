Changes from 0.13 to 0.14 - released 2013/xx/yy

*Added:

- compatibility with the eZ Publish REST API v2!
  Implemented both in the php layer and in the debugger (using REST type)

- make the webservices/execute view respect ValidateClientIPs even when server
  is behind a reverse proxy (needs eZP 4.5 or later and config in site.ini)

- debugger always displays status code, charset, content-type for all execute calls (REST first!)

- all the response classes now save http headers in $this->headers() when decoding
  a payload. This makes it easier to execute further processing, eg. support custom
  authentication schemes

- methods ggWebservicesClient::getOption() and ggWebservicesClient::availableOptions()

- new methods in class ggRESTRequest to set Accept header, or any custom header

- example code to interact with eZPublish REST API v2 in doc/samples

* Changed

- REST requests will happily receive a plaintext or html response without trying to decode it.
  This makes it easier to use them for interacting with sites (posting to forms etc)

- ggWebservicesClient::setOptions throws an exception when trying to set an invalid option

- it is possible that, when servers do not specify it, the charset of a response now defaults to empty whereas it defaulted to UTF-8 before

*Bugfixes:

- avoid strict errors with eZP5 LS

- make the debugger work correctly when testing the current server by using the
  admin siteaccess and plain php session handler

- all types of responses properly set their content-type, status code and charset on decoding

- debugger: only allow user to set content type when request has a body
