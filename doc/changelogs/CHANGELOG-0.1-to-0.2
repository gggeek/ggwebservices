Changes from 0.1 to 0.2

*General:
- added a complete debugger solution. Available by default in the admin interface. Access to it is regulated by the webservices/debugger policy.
- added support for proxies to calls to remote servers (ggeZWebservicesClient::send method). Proxies can be specified per-target or globally in site.ini
- added support for https connections even without curl installed
- sync jsonrpc.php and xmlrpc.php with soap.php from eZP 4.0.3: set timezone by default if it is not set in php.ini
- sync jsonrpc.php and xmlrpc.php with soap.php from eZP 4.1: allow to use different siteaccesses when calling webservices
- rewritten the jsonrpc.php and xmlrpc.php controllers to maximize code sharing
- removed html tags from ggeZWebservicesClient error strings
- shuffled error codes constants and values. Error code ranges now are:
    -1 to  -99: client-generated error codes when using curl (look into curl.h file in curl and multiply by -1)
  -102 to -199: errors generated by the client when not using curl
  -201 to -299: errors generated by the server
  -301 to -399: errors while parsing server response


*Bugfixes:
- more robust parsing of remote ws servers in ws_providers.ini in ggeZWebservicesClient::send
- one php crash fix when receiving an error from a remote server
