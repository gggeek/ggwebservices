Changes from 0.3 to 0.4 - released 2010/1/24

*Incompatible changes
- some static functions and variables of class ggeZWebservicesClient have been moved to a new class ggeZWebservices
- the files xmlrpc(s).inc, jsonrpc(s).inc have been renamed to xmlrpc(s).inc.php, jsonrpc(s).inc.php for ease of autoloading.
   Please update the autoload configuration to accomodate the changes

*General:
- added a cronjob to rotate logs of executed ws calls. By default added to infrequent set
- added support for calling external services that require simple POST (a.k.a. html forms) to the template fetch function / ggeZWebservicesClient class
- added a view to invoke webservices without the need of a specific controller file: /webesrvices/execute/$protocol (supported protocols are currently xmlrpc and jsonrpc)
- permissions to execute - with limitation on single webservices - can be granted on that view
- add support of exposing ezjscore webservices to xmlrpc/jsonrpc calls via that view
- moved javascript libraries to 'standard' design, so that they can be used for front-end interfaces too
- added the Y.io.jsonrpc javascript function for Yui 3 (in module 'io-jsonrpc') to ease execution of jsonrpc calls from the browser
- upgrade the included phpxmlrpc lib to 3.0.0 beta, fixing all warnings with php 5.3
- webservice server classes now catch exceptions raised by user-provided functions while handling invocation calls;
  use the server's $exception_handling member to finetune this behaviour
- allow module view (and custom controllers too) to load all functions in soap/jsonrpc/xmlrpc dirs
  regardless of the incoming call's protocol. Set RegisterAllProtocolsFunctions=enabled to activate

*Bugfixes:
- give a debuggable error message if soap extension is not enabled and user tries to create a ggPhpSOAPClient
- bad php contants where used by ggXMLRPCServer if invalid params where received
